Instructions for gtr module users

-----------------------

The gtr module was downloaded from the epics site.
The package version number used for this initial release was gtr2-3.

I - Building the gtr module:
--------------------------------------------------------

(1) Original code from EPICS site gtr2-3 has been modified for LCLS Controls Department.

(2) medm files have been converted to edm files

(3) gtr.db and gtrwaveform.db have been converted to gtr.template and gtrwaveform.template
    for supporting added macros. With appropriate substitutions, IOCs can define several devices.
	However, this means that when a new gtr module is released in EPICS site, these templates
	must be patched appropriately. This approach has been taken to centralize the changes rather
	than changing several IOC's gtr templates.

(4) Target Architecture was chosen to be RTEMS-beatnik.


II - Adding the gtr package to your IOC application:
----------------------------------------------------

(1) Add the appropriate GTR_MODULE_VERSION and GTR=$(EPICS_MODULES)/gtr/$(GENSUB_MODULE_VERSION)
    to configure/RELEASE file.
	
(2) Link gtr library into your app by adding to xxxApp/src/Makefile:

   xxx_LIBS += gtr

(3) Add the following .dbd file to xxxApp/src/Makefile or to xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd:

   xxx_DBD += gtr.dbd
   
(4) Add gtr databases to your application.  There are two database templates provided by the gtr module:
    
	gtr.template			(gtr.db with more macros)
	gtrwaveform.template	(gtrwaveform with more macros)
	
	Create substitution files for both these files in xxxApp/Db directory.
	
	For example substitution files see:
	
	gtr/<release>/testGtrApp/Db/gtr.substitutions
	gtr/<release>/testGtrApp/Db/gtrwaveform.substitutions	

    Note that gtrwaveform.substitutions file sets up SIS3300 FADC for 2 input channels 
    for a sampling size of 800 points.
	 
	
III - Adding gtr database and FADC configuration to your IOC startup file:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Refer to gtr/<release>/iocBoot/ioc/st.cmd.rtems for an example startup script.
	
(1) Ensure that EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES env variable is set to a large number for handling
    the waveform inputs in the IOC startup script. This value will be proportional to the
	number of input channels chosen and number of sampling points chosen for each channel.
	
(2) Load database created in the previous section (before iocInit).

    Example: 

    dbLoadRecords( "db/IOC-B025-MC01-gtr.db")
    dbLoadRecords( "db/IOC-B025-MC01-gtrwaveform.db")

(3) Add FADC configuration before iocInit.

	Example:
	
	sisfadcConfig(card, clockspeed, a32offset,intVec,intLev, useDma)
	sisfadcConfig(4,100,0x90000000,0x86,3,1)

    Note that the <card> must match the macro in the 
    substitutions file.  Each SIS device must have a unique card name.

(4) Remember to manually set the VME address on the GTR device to 
    match the one in the substitutions file.  Each card on a VME crate
    must have a unique address. This is generally settable via some rotary
	switches or jumpers in the module. read the User's manual for the
	device for more details.

(5) A couple of EDM displays are available for diagnostics:

	gtr/<release>/medm/gtrControl.edl
	gtr/<release>/medm/gtrWaveform.edl
	
    It requires the same same macros that are in their corresponding substitutions file.
	
    These can be added to xxxApp/srcDisplay directory and modified as required.

(6) For starting the GTR device, follow the instructions in the User's Manual for that particular device.

	Example: For SIS3300, to start the digitizer from an external triggered gate input:
	
    (a) From the gtrControl.edl display, set "arm" to 'postTrigger'.
    (b) Set 'autoRestart' to 'yes'.
	(c) Set 'trigger' to 'FP gate'.
    (d) Verify that 'clock' shows the clock rate chosen in sisfadcConfig()
    (e) Click on 'waveforms' and choose the ones that have been enabled in the database and on which
	    there are some input signals. Waveform display file gtrWaveform.edl pops up
		
		If everything goes well, the SIS3300 GTR display should be displaying the digitized waveforms!
		
Notes from Stephanie Allison for very old releases (<= gtr1-2):
---------------------------------------------------------------
vtr10012_8 only works with mv167 because of block transfers

vtr10012
  To get prePostTrigger to work I had to read status register after arming
  Cant get prePost to work with multiple events
