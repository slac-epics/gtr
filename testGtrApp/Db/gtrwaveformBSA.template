#
# Rem:	This file added has more macros to the original gtrwaveform.db file that was
#	bundled in the EPICS package gtr2-3
#	In the IOC application, use substitutions for expanding the macros. 
# 
# Macros:
#	Note:	'dev', 'area' and 'position' together identify a specific, accessbile device.
#		'name' and 'card' together identify a specific, controllable gtr module.	
#	dev	Name of the gtr (ADC) device. (DeviceType)
#		Example: For SIS3300, which is a Fast ADC, use FADC.
#	area	Location of your IOC that houses this gtr (ADC) device. (Area)
#		It describes one of the 21 areas currently in the LCLS Accelerator.
#		Example: For an IOC located in the beam dump on Line 1, use DMP1
#	position	Formed as (1 char optional) Position Prefix and (3 char) Position Code.
#		If Position Prefix is unspecified, it indicates Beam Line (B).
#		Position Code roughly indicates the position of the device in the area.
#		Example: 100 means that the device is roughly position i the first 10% of its area.
#	name	The name of the associated transient driver.
#		The name is read from the driver during record initialization. 
#		This should match with the name in the startup script st.cmd
#	card	The card (link) number of the particular (digital adc) recorder starting with 1.
#		The card number must match the value specified in the driver xxxConfig.
#		Example: 'card' specified in sisfadcConfig() command in the application startup script st.cmd.
#	signal		The input signal number
#				Example: 0-7 for SIS3300
#	size		The number of samples to acquire
#				Example: 8000
#	type		The waveform record data type.
#				Example: SHORT
#	desc		Description.
#				Example Include SIS Type name in the description if applicable as sis3300
