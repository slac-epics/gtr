# Abs:  LCLS GTR Waveform records
#
# Name: gtrwaveformBSA.template
# Author: Shantha Condamoor (scondam)
#
# Associated Display: gtrWaveform.edl
#
# Rem:	This file added has more macros to the original gtrwaveform.db file that was
#	bundled in the EPICS package gtr2-3
#	In the IOC application. 
# 
#	name	The name of the associated transient driver.
#		This should match with the name in the startup script st.cmd
#	card	The card (link) number of the particular (digital adc) recorder starting with 1.
#		The card number must match the value specified in the driver xxxConfig.
#		Example: 'card' specified in sisfadcConfig() command in the application startup script st.cmd.
#	signal	The input signal number
#		Example: 0-7 for SIS3300
#	size	The number of samples to acquire
#		Example: 8000
#	type	The waveform record data type.
#		Example: SHORT
#   	tse     Setting this field to a specific event code forces to set the timestamp in the gtrwaveform record by 
#               setting TSE=event-code-that triggered the waveform and setting the VME IRQ 
#               for that event code from the EVR triggers page (and in the proper substitutions file).
#               This is a work-around proposed by Stephanie Allison for BSA for waveform records.
#               This solution will work only for slow trigger rates and is not guaranteed for higher rates.
