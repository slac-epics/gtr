Version History:
R2.3-1.1.1  Marcio Donadio - 23/Jul/2019
            - Building for linuxRT-x86_64, RTEMS-beatnik, RTEMS-svgm, and
              RTEMS-mvme3100.

R2.3-1.1.0     Marcio Donadio - 25/Oct/2018
               - Imported from SVN to GIT and stitched with EED CVS and github
                 community branch. The module was not upgraded to the most
                 recent R2-4 version from community. PCDS and EED versions were
                 not merged.
               - EPICS base was updated to R3.15.

4/21/2011      - tlam
Increased the buffer size for the digitized data from 8K to 64K.

4/06/2011      - tlam
Fixed the problem of the DMA support function.

3/23/2011      - tlam
Merged in DMA support from E-beam group (gtr-R2-1-6).

3/7/2011       - bhill
Imported 3/7/2011 from ANL GTR module version R2-3:
http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/analog/gtr/index.html
Created $REPO/epics/trunk/modules/gtr/current via svn cp
as the starting point for our version of the gtr module.

Release Notes for the event package
-----------------------------------
gtr-R2-3-0:  gtrTest.substitutions and gtrwaveformTest.substitutions were added to support
             testing of the gtr software module before releasing for IOC applications.
             The substitution files also serve as an example for IOC developers.
             gtr.substitutions gtrwaveform.substitutions were removed so as not to clobber
             the original database templates namely, gtr.db and gtrwaveform.db.  So, now
             we install gtr.db and gtrwaveform.db as well.
             The difference between gtr.db and gtr.template is basically in how macros
             are named.  LCLS uses a macro naming convention that facilitates the use of
             the LCLS naming convention.

gtr-R2-1-7: (1) Till Straumann found a bad bug in drvRTEMSDma and fixed it.
			(drvUniverseDma has the same bug but  it is deprecated anyways [superseded by drvRTEMSDma]).
			Patched drvRTEMSDmaSup.c and drvUniverseDma.c
			
			Details of the BUGFIX: MUST NOT use a mutex for a lock since it is not released from the task context which acquired it!
   				This bug caused a task to never relinquish a temporarily inherited,
   				high priority (since it apparently always held this driver's mutex).
			
			(2) Lam T. from Photon Group found and fixed a bug in sis33xy driver related to DMA option.
			
			Details of the BUGFIX:  Fix for the problem of the DMA support for the SIS3301.
 					  "The problem is the sis3301 driver passes the wrong VME mapping address when it calls the DMA function.
					  There are 2 different address to use for the memory access during the data transfer with the VME bus. 
					  DMA access failed because the driver passed the converted address from the VME mapping address 
					  to the local address to the DMA function.
 					  Lam Thu fixed the problem by adding the new address pointer to the driver data structure 
					  and a flag to indicate whether the DMA function is selected or not.
 					  During the board configuration, if the useDMA option is set, the DMA address pointer will 
					  store the mapping VME address for later use.
 					  In the read function of the digitized data subroutine, if the DMA function is set, 
					  the mapping VME address will be used to pass to the DMA function instead of the local converted address.
					  
			Use case:	sisfadcConfig(1,100,0x21000000,0xc2,4,0)	# for SIS3300, no DMA
						(or)
						sisfadcConfig(1,100,0x21000000,0xc2,4,1)	# for SIS3300, with DMA


gtr-R2-1-6: Added DMA support for RTEMS with 'drvRTEMSDmaSup' from Till Straumann
			
gtr-R2-1-5: Forgot to commit RELEASE_SITE in the previous tag.
            Same as gtr-R2-1-4.
      
gtr-R2-1-4:  Rebuild gtr-R2-1-3 with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6 for backwards-compatibility sake of Motion control iocs that run with this base.
            CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS = RTEMS-beatnik
			
			For Shantha's Motion Control ioc-dmp1-mc01 that uses gtr module compatible with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6.
			
gtr-R2-1-3: Build with base-R3-14-11
            CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS = vxWorks-ppc604_long vxWorks-mpc8540 RTEMS-beatnik
			For Ernest's ATF2 work that has support for vxworks.
			
			Modified gtrwaveformBSA.template to include the TSE field and set SCAN interrupt PRIO to HIGH.
			Modified gtr.template.
			
gtr-R2-1-2: Added gtrwaveformBSA.template file to CVS and to Makefile

gtr-R2-1-1:	Added gtrwaveformBSA.template

gtr-R2-1-0:	Generic Transient Recorder (GTR) version 2.3 from:


		Build with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6
		Build with rtems-4.9.4

		Included in CVSROOT/modules as 'gtr'.

		Previous versions of CVS applications such as config,gtrApp,sisfadcApp,vtr*App have been removed 
		in this release	and is now consistent with the official EPICS gtr release site.
		These directories that were present in gtr1-2 were overhauled and removed in gtr2-3 by the
		EPICS colloboration supporting gtr.
		
		Only configure, gtrSup, drvUniverseDmaSup and testGtrApp are supported in gtr2-3. 

gtr-R2-0-1:	Generic Transient Recorder (GTR) version 2.3 from:
		http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/analog/gtr/index.html

		Build with base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6
		Build with rtems-4.9.4

		Included in CVSROOT/modules as 'gtr'.

		Previous versions of CVS applications such as gtrApp,sisfadcApp,vtr*App are unsupported 
		in the official EPICS gtr release site.
		Accordingly the directory 'config' and all these apps are ignored in the Makefiles.
		
		Only gtrSup, drvUniverseDmaSup and testGtrApp are supported. 
		Accordingly, the directory 'configure' and these directories are supported in the Makefiles.

		medm files converted to edm files with adl2edl.

		iocBoot provided for sample database and substitution files for IOC applications
		that use this gtr module.
		
		TARGET ARCH set to RTEMS-beatnik only in configure/CONFIG.
